#Each ability takes one line, just like a feat, and the first field must be the abilities' name. In the Example the name of the ability is My Ability.
#When naming feats you should only use parentheses at the end of the name if the name is not duplicated elsewhere. This is
#because of how PCGen names abilities which can be taken multiple times. For example, the Feat/ability Weapon Focus when taken will display
#as Weapon Focus(Dagger). Another example is Armor Proficiency (Light), there is no feat named Armor Proficiency so this name
#is fine. What is happening is when PCGen finds a feat with parentheses that duplicates the name of another feat it assumes
#that feat is an instance of the one without parentheses and does not display the one with parentheses.
#
#The TYPE tag is holding a . (period) delimited list of the types the ability/feat is.
#
#The MULT tag determines if a ability/feat can be taken multiple times. If the value is set to YES, then you MUST also use a CHOOSE
#tag.
#
#The CHOOSE tag must be paired with a MULT:YES tag in feats for it to work properly. It will display a popup window that asks
#for a selection according to what is being called for. There is a multitude of existing CHOOSE tags in PCGen. If you are
#looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic "CHOOSE tags".
# Assign the type SpecialQuality so that this shows up in the Special Qualities box.

Altmer - Stat Bonuses	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Racial Trait	DESC:Altmer have +2 INT, +2 CHA, -2 CON.
# See http://groups.pcgen.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=196 for explanation
# In theory, increasing BASESPELLSTAT adjusts number of spells cast per day, `CAST`, and the save DC, `DC`.
# The -4 penalty to DC|ALLSPELLS offsets the save DC increase from BASESPELLSTAT.
# However, increasing BASESPELLSTAT doesn't seem to increase the number of bonus spells. (It does increase save DC.)
